## Introduction

For this project, I revisited my Project 2 cafeteria observation study. I reused my original Google Form and added 20 new observations, focusing on queue length, food type, and any notable observations during lunch hour.

The form was designed to be simple and fast to use, which allowed me and my helpers to record data quickly. These observations were collected in a busy university cafeteria, and the new data was automatically logged in a connected Google Sheet.

My goal was to better understand the relationship between food preferences and how busy each stall was, and to add narrative context using text observations.

## Visualisation Summary

I created three visualisations based on the updated dataset:

### 1. Food Type Distribution

The first bar chart shows the frequency of different food types being ordered. It provides a visual summary of student preferences.

### 2. Queue Length by Food Type

The second plot compares the average queue length across food types. This shows how food choice may influence how long people have to wait.

### 3. Observational Comments â€“ Keyword Detection

The third chart uses text analysis to identify keywords like "slow" or "cut" from the comment field. This adds context and identifies unusual or interesting events.

All three plots were generated using `ggplot2` and saved as `.png` files, which were then displayed in my visual data story.

---

## Code Tools Used

In this project I used several tidyverse tools to process and visualise the data:

- `read_csv()` to import data directly from a Google Sheet
- `dplyr` for data cleaning (`rename`, `mutate`, `group_by`, `summarise`)
- `stringr` for text detection in comments
- `ggplot2` to generate bar plots and visual summaries
- `knitr::include_graphics()` to display static plots in RMarkdown

These tools made it easy to convert raw observations into clean and readable insights.

---

## Reflection

Through this project I gained more confidence in using R for visual storytelling. I learned how to structure a simple observational study, how to convert observations into clean data, and how to create and style an HTML-based story.

I also practiced embedding CSS directly into RMarkdown to enhance the visual appearance of my report. One challenge was aligning chart aesthetics with HTML layout, but I resolved this by adjusting image sizes and adding styling directly.

Most importantly, I saw how even simple observations â€” like what people eat and how long they wait â€” can reveal interesting patterns when visualised carefully.

## Code Appendix

Below is the R code I wrote and used in my `data_visualisation.R` file to produce the three static visualisations shown in the data story.

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)

# Read the dataset from Google Sheet
data_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ehSSLBWXz5UVCQPIX5Tr0pa0Wz6GDoakDDjipf9M0F0/export?format=csv"
raw_data <- read_csv(data_url)

# Rename columns for clarity
cafeteria_data <- raw_data %>%
  rename(
    queue_length = `How many people are currently queuing in the cafeteria?`,
    food_type = `What type of food do most people appear to be ordering?`,
    comments = `Are there any other notable things you observed?`
  )

# Plot 1: Food type distribution
plot1 <- ggplot(cafeteria_data, aes(x = food_type)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Food Types",
       x = "Food Type", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
ggsave("plot1.png", plot1)

# Plot 2: Average queue length by food type
plot2 <- cafeteria_data %>%
  group_by(food_type) %>%
  summarise(avg_queue = mean(queue_length, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = food_type, y = avg_queue)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Average Queue Length by Food Type",
       x = "Food Type", y = "Average Queue Length") +
  theme_minimal()
ggsave("plot2.png", plot2)

# Plot 3: Keyword detection in comments
plot3 <- cafeteria_data %>%
  mutate(comment_type = case_when(
    str_detect(str_to_lower(comments), "slow") ~ "Mentions 'slow'",
    str_detect(str_to_lower(comments), "cut") ~ "Mentions 'cut'",
    TRUE ~ "No keyword"
  )) %>%
  count(comment_type) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = comment_type, y = n, fill = comment_type)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Occurrences of 'slow' or 'cut' in Comments",
       x = "Comment Type", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
ggsave("plot3.png", plot3)
```
